My new portfolio site. A simple, lively and dynamic site, with clean lines and colors.

It is work in progress.

  -- update -- Using <img> instead of Next Image provides a short term solution.

Theme toggle needs finsihing and theme colors need to done in \_variables.

extra's maybe to be done:
  modal pop up after x seconds of inactivity to play 
  guess the skill game

Code needs to be refactored.
Netlify function needs to be made to control/hide the emailjs variables.

A Next.js project bootstrapped with create next app. Including Typescript, Sass, Styled Components.
